# Snake Game

This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Snake game.

## How to Run

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
Eat the red food squares to grow longer. If you hit the wall or yourself, the game
will reset.

## Publishing

Because the game consists entirely of static files (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), it
can be published easily using any static file hosting service.

### GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. From the repository's **Settings** page, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the
   branch that contains the game files (typically `main` or `master`).
3. Once enabled, GitHub will provide a URL where the game is publicly accessible.

You can also host the files on any simple HTTP server. For example, run
`npx serve` in the project directory or upload the files to your preferred static
hosting provider.
